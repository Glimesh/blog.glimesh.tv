The Glimcap 18

Welcome to the Glimcap 18. This week we have some big news coming later in June. As usual we are going over the metrics, financials, and wins that we’ve had over the past week. We will have a special announcement at the end of the article so make sure to get all the way to the end.

This week we’ve seen some of our socials continue on a downward trend. We have been reviewing our discord analytics and do not feel how we are monitoring them is appropriate so we will be looking at what we can do to better represent discord. Our reason for this is that although we are losing discord members the number of weekly visitors and interactions are up so it is entirely possible we are not tracking this correctly.

  

This week on Twitter we had a net loss of 1, Reddit we grew by 3, Instagram by 5, Facebook by 1 and Guilded by 2. Tiktok did not lose or gain this week but it has been a couple of weeks since we’ve posted anything to it.

  
  

Unique streamers and peak viewers are down in the past week but last week was Memorial Day in the US so people were spending time with family and friends so we are not concerned. It is a dip with an explanation but we will monitor next week just to make sure it was just a 1 time occurrence.

  

New users up by 200 this week and as you will see in the following section this has had some impact on other aspects of our traffic metrics too.

  

MRR down $360 over last month.

  

Support tickets this week were 16 following on from 21 the week before so within normal range.

# Traffic

Normally we are down about 10% on unique views, last week was only down 4% which was nice. We are continuing to see the same visit duration and bounce rate but did have more total page views.

# Twitter

Tracked previous full week and this week as well but these are for the past 28 consecutive days so are a rolling average. We are doing more tweets now thanks to the marketing channel pumping out a nice variety of content. We do have room to grow in engagements but that's something we will begin to focus on next.

  

Impressions and mentions are down but we are not concerned because profile visits are up and what we are wanting to see is people who find us on glimesh and really learn more about us, follow us and engage in the future. It takes more time to engage with people and what we are doing with marketing is setting groundwork for in the future.

  

Things like clips, emotes, gift subs all of these things will expand on marketing presence and every new follower we get now is someone we can announce new features too later.

Same slide from last week but with the final 2 days of May added. We’ve now been out out of DigitalOcean credits for a couple of weeks now. So starting the end of June will have a full look into expenses going forward from paying our own servers entirely. Our numbers are going down every week but we are committed to continuing to market, build new features, fix bugs and get community events out there so we can continue to be a platform you want to use. But right now we are at no risk of going away or running out of money. All of you who subscribe to other streamers or the platform you carry us through this. Revenue is still way higher than expenses and will continue to be higher. So thank you for your subs however you do it and while we may not be growing we are no risk of going out of business or disappearing and feel like we should say that.

# Phase 2

Like we said last week these aren't the only features that are being developed, there are others we are working on such as the channel statistics page which isn't on the roadmap but is important for streamers. While the channel statistics may not be perfect yet we have launched it now and have the chance to improve it and make it what you want.

  

We will be moving towards testing for the mobile app soon for IOS and Android. The main holdup has been that in developing this it became apparent that there were API and OAuth improvements which needed to be made before the mobile app development could continue. . We are now actively looking at video improvements for poor networks and prototyping better streamer support. We have launched the first 2 parts of custom channel emotes with more features such as being able to be used globally and being a subscriber only option coming next.

# Wins

-   Animated Emotes: if you are a streamer on Glimesh you can upload yours now in your emotes upload page.

-   You can now have 2 emotes, 1 animated, 1 static or any combination of that!
    

  

-   Support for PNG formats coming soon
    

  
  

-   Channel Statistics: Created by Ember it offers some basic information about when your stream started/ended, the category you streamed in, and what your peak viewership was during that stream. This will continue to expand and include more features over time.

Previously Guardian-Con this is a big event in the streaming world which started in 2016 and has raised over $14million and this year alone would like to raise $6million for St Jude this year.

  

Glimesh will be a part of GCX this year on the virtual space station where ticket holders make avatars and experience the convention in a videogame type format. We will have a booth, kiosks, and staff on hand to talk and interact with people to help out.

  

In addition to this Raredrop who are the people behind GCX will be hosting their main events from the GCX weekend on the Glimesh site, in addition to other sites from June 17th-19th 12noon - 4pm EDT  
  
So please check it out, help support the great cause and if you are abroad the space station be sure to come say hi to virtual Paco1342 and virtual RibenaBerri.

  

You can check out the GCX event here: [www.gcxevent.com](http://www.gcxevent.com)

  

We are really excited to be both a part of the event with our space aboard the station and also be part of the bigger collective able to host events from across the weekend on our stream.

  

We are really excited and hope to see you there!
