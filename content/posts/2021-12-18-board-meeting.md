## Executive Report
Hello everyone, welcome to the last board meeting of the year! Thank you all for your patience in getting one of these scheduled, my time as of late has been especially constricted. However as we go into the new year, I’ll personally be very free again to work on Glimesh and continue moving this ship along!

That’s not to say that we haven’t been busy though. In the past couple of months everyone who helps contribute has been working on several major features we hope will help in our growth efforts. The two big ones we’re making great progress on are the mobile app (which will be coming for both iOS and Android) and low-latency RTMP streaming. We’ve now done a successful 24 hour test stream of some blender movies with great quality and only minimal issues during packet loss. With the mobile app, we’ve now got it in the hands of some of the Glimesh GCT and our volunteer developers to help find some early show-stopping bugs. Once we have the viewer count counting mobile viewers, we’ll release the mobile app for testing. Then finally, when you’re able to watch streams without being logged in, we’ll release it to the general public.

On another note, I’m going to start focusing a little less on the specific features during these board meetings, due to the amazing results of our GCTalks meetings! They are happening very frequently now, and cover in great detail all of our features new & old. However we’ll still cover things at a high level, but if you haven’t already check out our blog to catch up on the GCTalks events!

Thanks for being here tonight, let us know if you have any questions and thank you for making this a great year for Glimesh!

## Metrics
Social media decline has been consistent for a couple of months now, due to no major social media campaigns or focuses. At the moment we’re mostly using it to inform our existing users, and keep a pulse beating so people know we’re alive.

Due to an unfortunate bug some of the data from our viewer counting is missing for September, October, and November. The bug was fixed in early December so the numbers should get back on track. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2fGs0x89LJ_w6zDyo1gFGRi0tIGxN_b-rIr0o72UDz6RwtQF3IKR-arD2owKNdgfKpyaD8zBNplQ3R2K5BM7ThzS1_SZ9LpHmqBBJpGZsgIIE6lGrJ5GcGiqmdKzqm-V9Nza5P80 "Chart")

However we have seen a nice trend with our average website traffic going up for the month of November. This spike can be attributed to our launch of the channel donations and 60/40 split feature, which we spread on Twitter and on our GCTalks very thoroughly. It’s also interesting to note the dip in traffic during America’s Thanksgiving.
