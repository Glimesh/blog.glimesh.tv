## Executive Report
Good evening everyone! I’m proud to announce we’ve had two board meetings on time, in a row!

It’s been an exciting year so far, with our Mobile App finally being released and our new focus on marketing. A good amount of time was spent this month working on filing our taxes for the last year. The good / bad news is none of our creators met the minimum threshold for tax filing this past year. 

The mobile app release has also gone extremely well, with just around 500 downloads so far across iOS and Android. So far the app has been welcomed by everyone, and the bug reports have been relatively minimal too, with only a couple of inconveniences impacting users. We ended up having some minor trouble with the iOS store, but that was quickly resolved with their review team. For now the mobile app will get mostly bug fixes, as our core attention switches to marketing. 

In RTMP news, we’ve made progress on thumbnail generation but core development still continues. In the near future we’ll need help testing the low-latency RTMP ingests, be on the lookout for an alpha test form so we can get you setup! 

Another surprise we’ve been holding on to is a brand new partnership with Glimli! Glimli is a set of simple add ons to make your Glimesh experience that much easier. Over the coming months we’ll be working with Brant to add some of Glimli’s basic functionality into Glimesh so new users can have dead simple ways of enhancing their stream. Our main goal will be to have an all in one basic package streamers can use for chat overlays, links, and alerts. The customization options will be minimal, so if you’re looking for more flexibility you can continue to rely on the other 3rd party options which are dedicated to these tools. 

And finally, work on growing Glimesh continues! March has been focused around planning both our marketing focuses and curating a list of content creators and brands we’d love to work with to grow Glimesh.

## Metrics
Currently our marketing metrics are still rather basic. We still need to update our metrics to track things we want to grow, so we can measure how campaigns are doing.

Overall the website traffic has been consistent for the past three months, which gives us a good baseline for growth.

## Finances
Our finance categories are split up into two categories: Software as a Service (generally recurring) and Physical Sales (generally one time). This financial spreadsheet breaks down those two categories, in addition to providing a traditional P&L itemization.

As a note, March was a very bad month for fraudulent charges on Glimesh. We ended up with 22 fraudulent charges amounting to $245. We’ve since tightened down some anti-fraud levels and are now manually reviewing every transaction. Thankfully due to our chargeback protection for our streamers, they lost no money from this fraud.

As far as our finances go, we’ve made strides at the beginning of April to cancel any unused services, and downsize our servers. This combined effort should result in about $300/mo savings, which can help out our profit line a bit. As we grow, I hope that users will continue to purchase channel subscriptions and help fund the platform directly through platform subscriptions.
