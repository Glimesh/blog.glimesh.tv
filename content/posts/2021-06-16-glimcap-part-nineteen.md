Welcome to Glimcap # 19! This week’s recap includes some news on GCX and some new updates on some of our roadmap items. This week we saw some different than normal metrics that we will be covering as well.

# Weekly Metrics

This week's growth and loss was a bit on the abnormal side. Discord continues its downward trend and we saw a large drop from Twitter. We believe that this drop from Twitter could be a number of things but we think that is because we had less than normal activity we did not have the growth that normally offsets the loss. But we will keep an eye on patterns and try to bring that number back up.

Reddit, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok have remained consistent with their patterns as well.

Guilded we ended up losing 2 members.

We saw a nice increase in viewership with a 985 increase to our peak viewers and an increase of 2 more unique streamers for the week.

Our MMR still continues to trend downward but our expenses are doing the same.

# Traffic

We saw some decreased traffic. Recently we have been focused on getting content out for GCX and to make sure everything is ready for that as well as working on the mobile app and other roadmap features. So we’ve been storing up a lot of our social media efforts for once we get some of these features fleshed out and the GCX gets going.

# Twitter

As mentioned earlier we have been a bit quieter lately while preparing for GCX and working on some of our roadmap items, but even so we did see some increase in mentions and profile visits which we can thank the community directly for.
