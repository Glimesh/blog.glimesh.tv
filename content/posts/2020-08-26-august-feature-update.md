Hi everyone! We're not launched yet (sorry) -- but we have a ton of updates that are now live on the site. I wanted to share them with you so you could continue to get a feel for Glimesh and how we'll work once we're launched!

### Internationalization (Translations!)

Glimesh is now available in other languages! Thanks to [@mja00](https://glimesh.tv/mja00/profile) we now have support for English, French, German, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish! If you want to help translate you can find our project at: https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=365285



### Two Factor Authentication (TOTP)

Enhance your account's security by activating two factor authentication! [@WildWolf](https://glimesh.tv/WildWolf/profile) has implemented a time based one time password algorithm which lets you use your phone (or other devices) to act as a second layer of security for your account! We're still working on recovery codes so if you lose access to your account please email us at support@glimesh.tv



### GraphQL API

Start working on your custom bots & services now, because our preliminary API is now available in a browser near you! Check out some documentation here: [https://github.com/Glimesh/glimesh.tv/wiki/GraphQL-API](https://github.com/Glimesh/glimesh.tv/wiki/GraphQL-API) and if you're interested in using it, hit us up in Discord!



### Stream Titles & Categories

We've added the ability to set your stream title (once you have one!) and category so other users can easily find your stream. We've got a couple of categories ready to go on the website related to Gaming, Art, Music, Tech, IRL, and Education.



### Report Button

You can now report streams (once we have them) and user profiles as inappropriate by clicking the Report User button.



### New Account Page

We've upgraded the account page a bit to give finer controls over your settings. This includes splitting the different sections of your account out so you can easily find and manage your settings.

And that about wraps it up! We're making some great progress, but we want to get this right. We can't wait for y'all to start streaming with us soon and put these great features to use. You can reserve your username and set up your profile now in preparation for launch at [https://glimesh.tv/users/register](https://glimesh.tv/users/register)!
