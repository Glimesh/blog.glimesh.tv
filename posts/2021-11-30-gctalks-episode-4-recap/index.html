Unfortunately, most of the players who signed up to participate in the tournament portion were unable to make it, except for one. The winner by default: BlitzkriegMeph. This did not stop the good time from being had! Instead of a tournament, the stream became more of a fun, happy nostalgia trip! All in all, it turned out to be a really good time, thanks of course to our amazing community, and to BlitzKriegMeph as well. Thank you again, HeelHarley!</li></ul><p><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HpK0rUBtB9nccAhCbswOKYtvT-QUSCBmLoJwccRaXIojuYeXJVV-2jqKphUUJPDp2IbcJET62rI7JwbvZgxSa4ynVD5mB-OGWgDAtZAGsejH_zn13p95bz9mtOOkcZoqWcpsebKu alt></p><p><strong>Upcoming events:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=https://glimesh.tv/Masquemare>Masquemare</a> will be hosting his second charity stream, dedicated to mental health awareness and suicide/self harm prevention. Starting on Friday November the 26th, he will continue to be raising money for a group called “To Write Love On Her Arms&rsquo;&rsquo; over his 2-day event. We will be witnessing some more variety gaming, possibly including some new VR games. Day two will be the day for multiplayer and community gaming shenanigans! There are challenges, incentives, and Streamloots around the cause! Begins 9 am Friday, November 26th, goes on through to the 27th at 12:30 pm EST.</li></ul><p><img src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rXBdWVzlGwtAvnUsJKR6_79vMV5_MW_A3SRnFW262sZzv_n1MKCztJy-090CasuKu_j5ZAaVVdfCWwHnDUbTcM1tUZbfxy_0objovV5qF47Ai3G96vu_mwnQH3ehaYVgp9D4Jh3F alt></p><ul><li>We will be welcoming the Chaos Collective for their first collaborative streaming event as brand new Glimesh Streamloots partners!! <a href=https://glimesh.tv/artofcod>ArtofCod</a>, <a href=https://glimesh.tv/blitzkriegmeph>BlitzKriegMeph</a>, and <a href=https://glimesh.tv/ferret>Ferret</a> (The Chaos Collective) plan to play Back4Blood together! As if this game isn’t already quite riddled with chaos, these madmen and madlady have created some brand new, specialty Streamloots decks for the occasion. These decks will mostly pit them against one another in the funniest ways; the community totally holds the reins over where this stream will go! This event will be kicking off on Saturday, November the 27th at 2 pm eastern time! For those across the pond, that’ll be 7 pm GMT!</li></ul><p><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LGcTu7WVLQdWdITH9bkZoYrQ2aPgKtqro_VoibMjy6gCQsuXrNkdf5y51NY6vjb2l3oOubq-qyowxhFpE4C0eFm_xzPZEfHQjoiGPh90-C_fwY7W2DpyRX9oXVxQEI6K7fbcOI25 alt></p><ul><li><p>Next month in December, <a href=https://glimesh.tv/SavageLifeX>SavageLifex</a> will be hosting her very first 2-day charity streaming event on Glimesh to spread holiday cheer to children across the UK and Scotland through Cash 4 Kids. It is her hope and ours as well that everyone will come together in the spirit of the holidays to help SavageLifex and Cash 4 Kids make sure that every child in the UK and Scotland receives a gift on Christmas morning. The stream will feature some pretty wide variety gaming, such as horror games, cozy games, and work out games. There will also be challenges and incentives for donations, such as being a part of an Animal Crossing FASHION SHOW! This event will take place on December 10th and 11th, starting at 12 pm GMT.</p></li><li><p>Later, in that month of December, we hope you’ll join <a href=https://glimesh.tv/Banjax>Banjax</a> and the community for another night of Goose Goose Glimesh hi-jinx and honks! This time it’s harder as you have to audibly HONK for the proximity chat any time you murder or mess up a task. And if you get caught? Take a drink! (whatever your fancy, alcohol is entirely optional). Goose Goose Duck is still free-to-play on Steam, and also very fun-to-play. You can have up to 16 people in one game, so it could get really wild! It starts at 7 pm GMT, on December the 18th! Here are his links, drop a follow if ya haven’t, and of course, check out those support options!</p></li><li><p>And finally, after the new year and the bulk of the holidays have passed, there will be a <a href=https://glimesh.tv/progeny>Progeny</a> Tournament hosted by ArtofCod featuring the new Halo Infinite game, a platform favorite right now. For this tournament, there will be about 8 teams of 2, competing to be in that number one spot for the digital trophy, and possibly other prizes, yet to be determined at this time. ArtofCod has a Progeny Discord for Tournaments, and you can find sign-ups and more information in there! There’s still plenty of time to sign up, so we hope to see a nice turnout! The tournament will take place on January the 9th, 2 pm EST, 7 pm GMT!</p></li></ul><p><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f4qjLoEXGelwCT4wXsQugbHos1DHsYras36HnoRX_nK3TmKT1Wf-BC21d47wjS1NoGqd1891IklKM2_WAmaQ2JefMklToFRAxyYDLtKw0D4OXvC2eQzpk81mSobzGtcMkNRkn1vP alt></p><p>If you are interested in having your event supported by our Events Team, check out these links:</p><ul><li><p>Event application form: <a href=https://forms.gle/6VpqMzc6i1XomaP86>https://forms.gle/6VpqMzc6i1XomaP86</a></p></li><li><p>Guide for getting your event featured on Glimesh: <a href=https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/15-channel-help/181-how-to-get-my-event-featured-by-glimesh>https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/15-channel-help/181-how-to-get-my-event-featured-by-glimesh</a></p></li></ul><h2 id=how-to-get-vods-and-clips-on-glimesh>How to get VODs and Clips on Glimesh</h2><p>Presented by BlitzkriegMeph</p><p>While Glimesh may not have native clips and VODs yet, we do have some handy tips and workarounds to make sure you can still get the content you want from your stream.</p><p><strong>Clips:</strong></p><p>The replay buffer allows you to set your PC to constantly hold the last set seconds of video as you stream. When the replay buffer is set to a hotkey you press it it will “clip” that section and save it directly to your PC. Make sure you are aware of your PC’s limits, as this will get more resource-intensive the longer you set it. We recommend 20-30 seconds to make sure you get your clip and don’t compromise your PC.</p><p><strong>VODs:</strong></p><p>You can set your OBS/Streamlabs to record when you go live, which will save the video directly to your PC. This is perhaps the easiest way to get your VODs, but is highly resource-intensive on your PC.</p><p>You can find more detailed information about how to set up the replay buffer and recordings of your streams for Streamlabs and OBS via our guides here:</p><ul><li><p>Replay buffer support article: <a href=https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/7-stream-settings/163-recording-clips-locally>https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/7-stream-settings/163-recording-clips-locally</a></p></li><li><p>Video guide: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLQPoo3YC9o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLQPoo3YC9o</a></p></li></ul><p>A less resource-intensive way to get your full stream recorded is using <a href=https://airca.st/>Aircast</a>. With Aircast, you can set up to restream your Glimesh stream to Youtube as an unlisted video. This takes all the strain off your PC and allows you to download the video and edit it up later.</p><p><em><strong>Important tip</strong></em> Make sure to request your stream key from YouTube at least 24 hours before you intend to start recording your streams and make sure to set Glimesh as the primary source because of our FTL protocol, or this will not work.</p><p><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z_2d8_X-1jhUiuvpaTsvDgtX3giz4y1YjqC2FVS5uFeqCG9we7l0w9tMDn_NAVBjV9Ov-HQrm2b-BHc8PNPYf03yd1VmgDWojwPDGAzSJ4BEmoCpUcKx1Cy37QQoxLQoaGictkSw alt></p><h2 id=using-subcategories-and-tags>Using subcategories and tags</h2><p>Presented by Paco1342</p><p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XpGNl8dd8Rlf11TQ68JQCDGA7Q0mcal2EcrHft8-aYdVq_YjKUzdL2p49u9muKiT6hoSNdL8jgWwy5k16tBws6WXpj7rIvuseDf53Ea1MHlyD9xLvvpnj8vx1HX_5esejbe4eMgb alt></p><p>Subcategories and tags on Glimesh are your number one key to discoverability as they are how viewers filter streams. We felt that this topic would be an important one to cover for both streamers and viewers to help them get the most out of their streams on Glimesh.</p><p><strong>For streamers:</strong></p><p>The first step is to choose one main topic/game tag, this is category-specific as you can see in our list below:</p><ul><li>Gaming - Game Name</li><li>Art - Style</li><li>Education - Topic</li><li>IRL - Topic</li><li>Music - Genre</li><li>Tech - Topic</li></ul><p>You can set this to be anything you want, as long as it remains within the rules set out by the Terms of Service and Rules of Conduct. If a tag does not yet exist simply type the tag in and press enter, this will add it to the database for next time.</p><p><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ErDuX4FhBj6QPL0nwu9P0S6TwLYLR7uW_RtHsN9WdFmQNjIxK7ARpJaVpExThzpIf47eTiizWGuehhTOQ8pXWswvAVMFLKNARbE3pdFIRJ00WMczSUFujoNjpCza1zj30tegb4MT alt></p><p>The next step is tags. Tags are the way for you to describe your channel or stream. For example, you might have a specific clan tag you use or your stream may be a chill stream. These can be as unique as you are or you can look at how often a tag is used and select based on popular tags.</p><p><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GNj_3jV6Uguna97PbaTGgplHyQHPIHpl6TzN7XclHFo44ojbdnzv4L_bf5Gg4PghrpHoheWbCc95rqLFQjDXqjDSbxXdrd95gisk5R-3c8G76_5cyRwMrbfiOEdxu8ao3vkNPAUM alt></p><p>Much like the subcategory tags, you can create tags if they do not yet exist, create your own trend!</p><p>For those who like to stream with friends, this is a great way of linking your streams through a unique tag that allows viewers to search that tag and find every stream using it - connecting you all and allowing you to easily share communities!</p><p>Something important to remember is that tags do have character limits: they cannot be shorter than 2 letters, nor can they be longer than 18 tags. You also cannot use special characters in your tags. If a tag flashes red and disappears, check you are following these rules.</p><p>For more guides on how this works:</p><ul><li><p>Tags support article: <a href=https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/15-channel-help/117-tags-what-are-they-and-how-to-use-them>https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/15-channel-help/117-tags-what-are-they-and-how-to-use-them</a></p></li><li><p>Subcategories support article: <a href=https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/15-channel-help/139-how-do-i-set-which-game-i-am-playing>https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/15-channel-help/139-how-do-i-set-which-game-i-am-playing</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>For viewers:</strong></p><p>For viewers, the tagging system is how you can refine your streams and find content suited to you, whether by searching using the subcategory or looking for more specific tags (or a combination of both!).</p><p><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hPrQ8F64kTdFVdHdIMMeSG3Fiskt6q5ijVbUs0fdPs5CAL6Sz5TnqPlCxjfhBD_6wLjYSUxkeYtyVmxRtot7vKtvMku2r2TTW2_L7nN0kcTac-5RoT-bcW5PDuugPG8wHlav3T6o alt></p><p>You will see these boxes at the top of each streaming category, simply type in the kind of content you are looking for and it will filter the results.</p><p>Something important to remember is you cannot use special characters in your tags. If a tag flashes red and disappears, check you are following these rules. If you are following these rules and your tag still disappears without bringing up any results, it means no one is currently streaming using those tags.</p><p>You can find more information on how this works here:</p><ul><li>Subcategory and Tags filter for viewers support article: <a href=https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/39-viewer-help/161-how-to-filter-streams>https://support.glimesh.tv/en-us/39-viewer-help/161-how-to-filter-streams</a></li></ul><h2 id=building-glimesh>Building Glimesh</h2><p>Presented by ArtofCod</p><p><a href=https://build.glimesh.tv/><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/D7D5F6I9y8FHg-0iU-nHNJQ8Lev7bYnrjgbS84qmPKkwDgDezrzlg8XCIHicHg8xmPOCVHk0H17QeSWJrqjZwj1TgaUAMXUp9ywFjxpCQUWmm1yvM1r-s9xgyGjXy1Ivev2pab5d alt></a></p><p><strong>Winter on Glimesh:</strong> Winter is fast approaching here at Glimesh and we are wanting to bring a bit of it to Glimesh with a winter-themed logo and winter-themed Glimdrops!

While it may be a little late this year to get something of such a scale planned, we are definitely a big fan of this unique way to bring the community together.

Should whispers appear in chat visible to only the person being whispered to but move with the flow of chat, should stream moderators be able to see whispers? Or should it be more of a direct messaging system with a separate inbox? How should this be moderated by the Glimesh Community Team?</p><p>We would love to hear your thoughts on this topic. There’s no doubt some system for whispers/DM’s would be a great addition to Glimesh, but how this should be implemented is still definitely up for discussion!</p><ul><li>Whispers/DMs discussion: <a href=https://build.glimesh.tv/t/whisper-dm-ability/267/6>https://build.glimesh.tv/t/whisper-dm-ability/267/6</a></li></ul><p><strong>Stream Schedule/Calendar:</strong> Again, this has been a topic of much discussion across the time of Glimesh and something we think would be a great addition to the platform. Like all features, this would be entirely optional if a streamer wants this to be shown. The discussion on Building Glimesh is still in its early stages, but if this is something you think you would be interested in, please, do voice your suggestions for how you think this should look, and how it should work. Current suggestions include a way to use the subcategories to show what you will be streaming alongside when you are streaming and how we could best display time zones for those elsewhere in the world.</p><ul><li>Stream schedule discussion: <a href=https://build.glimesh.tv/t/stream-schedule/340/3>https://build.glimesh.tv/t/stream-schedule/340/3</a></li></ul><h2 id=glimesh-news>Glimesh News</h2><p>Presented by Paco1342</p><p><strong>Payouts on the rise:</strong> We are very happy to announce that since our last GCTalks and the launch of our donation system we have seen the biggest creator payout since launch!
