We have been reviewing our discord analytics and do not feel how we are monitoring them is appropriate so we will be looking at what we can do to better represent discord. Our reason for this is that although we are losing discord members the number of weekly visitors and interactions are up so it is entirely possible we are not tracking this correctly.</p><p>This week on Twitter we had a net loss of 1, Reddit we grew by 3, Instagram by 5, Facebook by 1 and Guilded by 2. Tiktok did not lose or gain this week but it has been a couple of weeks since we’ve posted anything to it.</p><p>Unique streamers and peak viewers are down in the past week but last week was Memorial Day in the US so people were spending time with family and friends so we are not concerned. It is a dip with an explanation but we will monitor next week just to make sure it was just a 1 time occurrence.</p><p>New users up by 200 this week and as you will see in the following section this has had some impact on other aspects of our traffic metrics too.</p><p>MRR down $360 over last month.</p><p>Support tickets this week were 16 following on from 21 the week before so within normal range.</p><h1 id=traffic>Traffic</h1><p>Previous full week:</p><p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/khMOnE5G7jokUxTAoCDmK-BQGQ7ddP21gjYObyYx7eOo0Xef0EpdkQoQdeK0bHW20acpLsjVZeT-TRFdwwyql_xl5q3j-3KtbrLgx-Dwc-QXSTE2eYcwfJe5Ko0ySw7oNRUWBE8Z alt></p><p>Current:</p><p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SoaMAVRG7ya2S_hW6n9FbnWTsGvBE5xLk4ctUaUIzCakO4TSZkQ6DyEx2Plfj9byvCIjYhz84AW3qAiwhV8wOYReRTzJC83g6kFKGWmJJ1TDUMApro3BgS1ECztX8Oa70y4NcGnc alt></p><p>Normally we are down about 10% on unique views, last week was only down 4% which was nice. We are continuing to see the same visit duration and bounce rate but did have more total page views.</p><h1 id=twitter>Twitter</h1><p>Previous full week:</p><p><img src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/V1jKnZa8g_5H3vnG4PUnapo9BmgF_KRP6z4jbyRCSYQjGRyxvx97kKsgDcUmncBQRaF8wYRrYzmbne4ztXB1pPFrZWWPgnUb-tm-Ketkx_T3-WV-KujHiyntI77yxGZ_2ZzJiByF alt></p><p>Current:</p><p><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/68LKGLwWEVD-vAG2IEGFm9klcHTsnKEKjxzgpZtt7KUVdhgkPF_MVCPFSI8lfDRJI0L9YZq0IUGXu8W7ToD43IxP6bQTQddk1WyP2YNS6o9eGtUZrLd5hB9Nde4pW7GavFiyn48Y alt></p><p>Tracked previous full week and this week as well but these are for the past 28 consecutive days so are a rolling average. We are doing more tweets now thanks to the marketing channel pumping out a nice variety of content. We do have room to grow in engagements but that&rsquo;s something we will begin to focus on next.</p><p>Impressions and mentions are down but we are not concerned because profile visits are up and what we are wanting to see is people who find us on glimesh and really learn more about us, follow us and engage in the future. It takes more time to engage with people and what we are doing with marketing is setting groundwork for in the future.</p><p>Things like clips, emotes, gift subs all of these things will expand on marketing presence and every new follower we get now is someone we can announce new features too later.</p><h1 id=may-financials>May financials</h1><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td>March</td><td>April</td><td>May</td></tr><tr><td>Gross</td><td>$12,550.00</td><td>$9,510.00</td><td>$7,540.00</td></tr><tr><td>Payouts</td><td>-$2,795.34</td><td>-$2,036.12</td><td>-$1,665.89</td></tr><tr><td>Stripe Fee (for prev month)</td><td>-</td><td>-$1,230.11</td><td>-$1,074.47</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>$8,761.10</td><td>$5,531.40</td><td>$4,231.41</td></tr><tr><td>DO Credits</td><td>$8,042.78</td><td>$3,123.86</td><td>$1,074.70</td></tr><tr><td>DO Infra</td><td>$2,285.04</td><td>$1,483.81</td><td>$1,459.07</td></tr><tr><td>DO Bandwidth - Overage</td><td>$2,498.91</td><td>$565.35</td><td>$0.00</td></tr><tr><td>DO Expenses</td><td>-$4,918.92</td><td>-$2,049.16</td><td>-$1,459.07</td></tr><tr><td>Remaining Credits</td><td>$3,123.86</td><td>$1,074.70</td><td>$0.00</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;Budget&rdquo; Remaining</td><td>$3,842.18</td><td>$3,482.24</td><td>$2,772.34</td></tr><tr><td>Actual Remaining</td><td>$8,761.10</td><td>$5,531.40</td><td>$3,928.92</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6CmL03ZJaMaJENKvl0o247eSRnxsfIxtOhMzrn11IoXUMcEeTAUDbNIKdDh4090QE0yGKSMliG3ecYRs5D9PEUVGefiFbv-uUr96JsTU-RbugqNiH3SX0HXFQuel9WWX2SN9teJU alt></p><p>Same slide from last week but with the final 2 days of May added. We’ve now been out out of DigitalOcean credits for a couple of weeks now. So starting the end of June will have a full look into expenses going forward from paying our own servers entirely. Our numbers are going down every week but we are committed to continuing to market, build new features, fix bugs and get community events out there so we can continue to be a platform you want to use. But right now we are at no risk of going away or running out of money. All of you who subscribe to other streamers or the platform you carry us through this. Revenue is still way higher than expenses and will continue to be higher. So thank you for your subs however you do it and while we may not be growing we are no risk of going out of business or disappearing and feel like we should say that.</p><h1 id=phase-2>Phase 2</h1><h1 id=httpslh6googleusercontentcommetjr4gthsagnznszbdqamyvkhbe3ltrqwap75_6xakts0thq90edfk3wsn9wlzsqrwiwchmwghc95xnxlj4lzweqewzddjw8egohxqvmxnbnumf74jkkofx3faefjw-w3uh6ao0><img src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/meTjR4GTHsagnZnszBDQaMYVkhBe3ltRqwaP75_6XaKTS0thq90EDfK3WSN9wlZSQrWiWCHmWgHC95XNxLj4LZweqeWZdDJW8eGoHxqvMxNBnUmf74JKKofX3fAeFJw-w3uh6ao0 alt></h1><p>Like we said last week these aren&rsquo;t the only features that are being developed, there are others we are working on such as the channel statistics page which isn&rsquo;t on the roadmap but is important for streamers. While the channel statistics may not be perfect yet we have launched it now and have the chance to improve it and make it what you want.</p><p>We will be moving towards testing for the mobile app soon for IOS and Android. The main holdup has been that in developing this it became apparent that there were API and OAuth improvements which needed to be made before the mobile app development could continue. . We are now actively looking at video improvements for poor networks and prototyping better streamer support. We have launched the first 2 parts of custom channel emotes with more features such as being able to be used globally and being a subscriber only option coming next.</p><h1 id=wins>Wins</h1><ul><li>Animated Emotes: if you are a streamer on Glimesh you can upload yours now in your emotes upload page.</li></ul><p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/C_HhoDHYkOEPwoW24PeOrfs75Ov5hff1LYaSdKituyvaqnLgwWq1Ief5B-dQo1ztBx5NtmzNDUpDdJyifIa5cXLicD71U1cm-e2xhif9h8JvVu-_vgOpUcHfFqrRxAWrTbtBGSHX alt></p><ul><li><p>You can now have 2 emotes, 1 animated, 1 static or any combination of that!</p></li><li><p>Support for PNG formats coming soon</p></li><li><p>Channel Statistics: Created by Ember it offers some basic information about when your stream started/ended, the category you streamed in, and what your peak viewership was during that stream.
