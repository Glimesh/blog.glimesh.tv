<time datetime=2021-05-26T08:00:00-04:00>Wed May 26, 2021</time> by Heiwa and RibenaBerri</p><p>Welcome to the 16th Glimcap. This week we will be looking at the business in depth, briefly touching on the progress which is being made with Phase 2 Alpha features, and as always rounding up some wins and challenges from the past week.</p><h1 id=weekly-metrics>Weekly Metrics</h1><p>This week we are seeing the benefits of our dive back into being active on social media with an overly positive week. <a href=http://discord.gg/glimesh>Discord</a> has dropped numbers dramatically from being down 20 last week, to down 120 this week. However, we think this is because people are joining other servers and needing to leave some as a result, we are not concerned about this.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/glimesh>Twitter</a> is up by 4, <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Glimesh/>Reddit</a> by 6, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/glimesh/>Instagram</a> by 4, <a href=https://www.facebook.com/Glimesh>Facebook</a> and <a href=https://www.tiktok.com/@glimeshtv>Tiktok</a> each by 1 and <a href=https://www.guilded.gg/glimesh>Guilded</a> by 21.</p><p>We have some new metrics being tracked now which are unique streamers and peak viewers. You can track both of these on the website but we will continue to offer a weekly comparison here. Both unique streamers and peak viewership is up from last week.</p><p>MRR is down again this week by $150 which is the equivalent of 30 subscriptions expiring.</p><p>Support tickets are again relatively consistent with 27 this week compared to 34 the week before.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>This Week</td><td>Last Week</td><td>Diff</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Discord</td><td>5,652</td><td>5,772</td><td>120⬇</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>9,264</td><td>9,260</td><td>4⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Reddit</td><td>606</td><td>600</td><td>6⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>1,176</td><td>1,180</td><td>4⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>624</td><td>623</td><td>1⬆</td></tr><tr><td>TikTok</td><td>67</td><td>66</td><td>1⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Guilded</td><td>174</td><td>153</td><td>21⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Unique Streamers</td><td>384</td><td>367</td><td>17⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Peak Viewers</td><td>2710</td><td>2,545</td><td>165⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>40,081</td><td>39,751</td><td>330⬆</td></tr><tr><td>MRR</td><td>$6,660</td><td>$6,810</td><td>$150⬇</td></tr><tr><td>Support Tickets</td><td>27</td><td>34</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TaWtWlm8Kc3sahOKZNBFmy2Uc5q6nZ822yF3kdhjI7zA72wsmYc9rc7GU6I0p5gXccLDIrVMxaaWTGYfUgElDr-WhKk39b2aK0ia-CzsHSgftwPk06aHNiJFuHj8F-1GF2ySasX alt></p><p><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7Nc5le2MiL_pLGwEtygWNpanTmAfjYjCg_IjrYRqrgJLkcPPb5NmSgrN9dIbPfPEqxvO22H4OIYSf_2URSObg16V5AtT245Q08wSmAeIbyiiyu1E9n_mT1RYNcJJXMMf0ovdALef alt></p><h1 id=traffic>Traffic</h1><p>This week is looking good. We are down only 100 unique visitors from last week so it is really close.

Gift subscriptions and raiding have also begun early development. For us right now hosting and raiding will be one and the same as one leads into the other quite naturally.</p><p>Most of the progress currently has been with channel emotes and the phone app itself. The phone app is currently waiting on oauth changes but once that is in place we will almost be ready for internal testing which we can then expand to a wider audience as bugs get fixed.</p><h1 id=httpslh5googleusercontentcomwrvbly8ghfbyae9lsm3fyqeod9rxy5xtokhxfyo-0itp1w7phvbgnjfyc_5nbyheyxy2f3bkgdmpzdpzkninh3x1vvf2imi57gffiubgwsmqsa3tiftwbjacdly1nxeahkklwqtx><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wRVbLY8GhfbyAE9LSm3fYqeOd9Rxy5XtoKHXFyO-0iTP1w7PHVBGNjfyc_5nBYHEYxy2F3BkGdMpZdpZknINh3x1VVF2imI57gfFiUBgwsmqSA3TifTWBJacdLy1nxeahKkLwqTx alt></h1><p><img src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RT3IIMnmGJjex0pjQulk4TAbzOvecJ4b5P7ROS-v6ht2NS6qmCosgfXj_P4_VFL2YINvAju--1Kmj-9AXQFGIwURcdAOcgAYxuHOolDuZz0vqWMewAL9qF7b-99TQMUmMkcQR1Up alt></p><h1 id=wins>Wins</h1><ul><li>Our first true community hosted event went ahead last week with Kizime holding a 14 hour stream on Sunday. $1200 was raised for Save the Children by both existing and new users to the Glimesh platform.

If you are having packet loss or stream issues it is worth trying out as it is located directly in Australia, if you are interested in helping test it please head over and open a ticket in our <a href=https://discord.gg/yJ47UtSv3B>#streaming-help</a> channel in discord.</p></li><li><p>We now have a new Metal royalty free music playlist courtesy of Backing Track which you can find more information about, as well as other approved DMCA safe music over on our <a href=https://glimesh.tv/about/dmca>DMCA page</a>.</p></li></ul><h1 id=contributor-role-changes>Contributor role changes</h1><p>We are swapping the contributor role to make it more clear and open as to how you can contribute to glimesh in the essence of keeping open, fair and equal to everyone. Going forward if you wish to contribute to any of our Building Glimesh channels in discord you will need to assign yourself a role to interact in those channels. You can do that in the #how-to-contribute channel in the Discord. For those who don’t assign a role you will still be able to keep up to date with what is happening as the channels are still visible they are just read only.</p><p>We believe this to be a positive step by allowing everyone who contributes whether on a small level or large to all be on an equal field, no exclusive color roles in discord or on the website, just the community working together.</p><p>The channels we already have won’t change but we hope that these changes will encourage more interaction within the channels. Each channel will have its own standard processes for how things are run, kept track of, and discussed and we hope this will make it easier for everyone. Ultimately we want this change to reflect the open company we are continuing to build and hope to encourage everyone to take part of.</p><p><img src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ST60nJNutRffhbjpF22M_PNwxC40Qyxk4UIfxiiMIJhR2tMDxVSUTk5o3v9a3Vy0S2QKE3Yr_TqVpw3Cp3S-tA6tlIGD6c7_wcxatpSa_dZxpUiM-wf343hzWZj1DYoMd4M2_asP alt> <img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bPDrzumTkqqyCTi3TpHP2wrsV8xt6JZz6jmMl6OI1qTwwipTjhspmmYr0xEX4kCXTxP-mo19f5KFq2NYk_qu1THPMPnrCqeREvKd7RRQmpabGvZ0Der3xPP2qP88g-rp7er00IdP alt></p><hr><footer><section><h4>Share</h4><ul class="nav sharing-icons"><li class=nav-item><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.glimesh.tv%2fposts%2f2021-05-26-glimcap-part-sixteen%2f&text=The%20Glimcap%2016">Share on Twitter <span class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></span></a></li><li class="nav-item ml-4"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fblog.glimesh.tv%2fposts%2f2021-05-26-glimcap-part-sixteen%2f">Share on Facebook <span class="fab fa-facebook-f" aria-hidden=true></span></a></li></ul></section></footer></article></div></div></div><aside class="col-lg-3 ml-auto blog-sidebar"><section class="sidebar-module sidebar-module-inset"><h4>About</h4><p dir=auto>Learn about streaming, marketing, programming, and more on the Glimesh company blog!</p></section><section class=sidebar-module><h4>Recent Posts</h4><ol class=list-unstyled><li><a href=/posts/glimesh-community-pride/>Glimesh Community Pride</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2022-05-04-board-meeting/>Board Meeting 05/2022</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2022-04-06-board-meeting/>Board Meeting 04/2022</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2022-03-02-board-meeting/>Board Meeting 03/2022</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2021-12-18-board-meeting/>Board Meeting 12/2021</a></li></ol></section><section class=sidebar-module><h4>Glimesh</h4><ol class=list-unstyled><li><a href=https://glimesh.tv/about>About Us</a></li><li><a href=https://glimesh.tv/about/dmca>DMCA Policy</a></li><li><a href=https://glimesh.tv/about/faq>Frequently Asked Questions</a></li><li><a href=https://glimesh.tv/about/open-data>Open Data</a></li><li><a href=https://support.glimesh.tv>Support</a></li></ol></section></aside></div></div><footer class=mt-4><section class="footer-social pt-2 pb-2"><div class=container><div class="btn-group btn-block" role=group aria-label="Glimesh Socials"><a href=https://twitter.com/Glimesh class="btn btn-default"><i class="fab fa-twitter-square fa-3x"></i></a>
