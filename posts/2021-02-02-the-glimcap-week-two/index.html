Our goal is to give you a recap of the Tuesday team meeting for the week. This way if you weren’t able to make it you can still get some of the details of the meeting. We’ve decided to officially name this weekly new recap “The Mesh”. We want to make sure we keep everyone connected to what&rsquo;s going on at Glimesh.</p><h2 id=glimeshs-growth>Glimesh’s Growth</h2><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>This Week</th><th>Last Week</th><th>Diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discord</td><td>2,465</td><td>2,381</td><td>84⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>4,389</td><td>4,179</td><td>210⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Reddit</td><td>269</td><td>263</td><td>6⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>305</td><td>278</td><td>27⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>193</td><td>185</td><td>8⬆</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>11,847</td><td>11,232</td><td>615⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Apps</td><td>50</td><td>48</td><td>2⬆</td></tr><tr><td>MRR</td><td>$310</td><td>$290</td><td>$20⬆</td></tr><tr><td>Support Tickets</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>5⬆</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here are this week’s growth metrics. We had some good growth across the board even seeing some spikes on Instagram. Our growth continues consistently and strongly week by week. We also have added a new metric that may expand in the future and that is Support Tickets. This will track weekly the number of support tickets that we are receiving.</p><p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ay4QaJwl2N1NO7fMOWcrOqZbyj5xlk3JyUWwUtmxMc7P1BtLSklFgCgUJSY9MlgZ2MGSHetpqNOoZ4P6M7OyEcsiBPY7NjHs4St10SY8oSzfWkkUDrQtMlu-gsOdD2J8cLD0R0n_ alt><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/k2IPCIAOcm5Qssm-0hri5PosI8dVWCbUbxat5jqmfMOeJOer9PYNnyqcmrPzTds_BgfTEVFkjyze4gENKOvTPAcQIDma8NvPoHYiDtQ-aJ21bS_wJ_hp60oIy2M1eDjfDrCkysms alt></p><p>As a reminder that these graphs are available on <a href=https://glimesh.tv/about/open-data>https://glimesh.tv/about/open-data</a>.

But this shows our billing growth, product sales, and overall revenue growth.</p><h2 id=wins>Wins</h2><h2 id=we-launched-the-glimcap>We launched the Glimcap!</h2><p>We officially had our first weekly recap blog. If you missed last week’s post, you can check it all out here: <a href=https://glimesh.tv/blog/2021-01-29-the-glimcap-part-one>https://glimesh.tv/blog/2021-01-29-the-glimcap-part-one</a>. We’ve renamed this to “The Mesh&rsquo;&rsquo; and are hoping that this will become a lasting piece of the Glimesh community to keep everyone informed with what is going on.</p><h2 id=trademark--dmca-agent-registration>Trademark / DMCA Agent Registration</h2><p>We have officially registered the name Glimesh as a trademark. This will give us just another legal protection and further solidify our presence in the market as an official trademarked company.</p><p>We’ve also registered as an official DMCA Agent. This means that we are now able to have the safety of safe harbor in accordance with the DMCA. This also gives copyright holders a single point of contact they can easily find for Glimesh to help better manage DMCA takedown requests. This is another step to help keep us legally compliant to the DMCA.</p><h2 id=dev-team-wins>Dev Team Wins</h2><p>Those who have been paying close attention will have noticed a couple of new features appear live on the site this week.</p><p>First up, you can now switch between languages and Dark/Light mode, even when you aren’t logged in.

Glimboi is still in the works, but <a href=https://glimesh.tv/Mytho/profile>Mytho</a> has been working hard towards creating a full functioning chatbot. The bot can respond to and make commands, use command variables, create users in the bot database, log chat messages to a text file, and store quotes. Glimboi chat bot is currently in Alpha and Mytho has extended an invitation to those who would like to do some bug hunting and get a sneak peak. It isn’t ready yet though to set up for your stream.</p><p><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/F8qpBj6IAxfDP2NKhCKTFon-4M0tjZdEEy6NsPKtQunaMs_yvhVEg4mMFApQQ8f_R6hi2v2JM3tWSmewBScrCfJCv2zLuOw5UMnqbq6oUGJfI5xIh66lKFcrivRo11eewfkJAdc- alt><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xt2LSCzHs0bgbfy7IKqO3LWfc3xA92gmmIFVNHGwGK29xGZmMKs_WL94uRje_dJ8SL2G82PGHjj48yvbcC0POhfizRDodFU-AGOtOAEOm-AiO6HfNGsX72UWIXdTx96on55Wmh5A alt></p><p>If you are interested in helping support the Alpha Bug Hunt the download link is available here: <a href=https://github.com/aMytho/GlimBoi/releases/tag/v1.1.0>https://github.com/aMytho/GlimBoi/releases/tag/v1.1.0</a></p><p>And the instructions for authenticating the bot can be found here:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/aMytho/GlimBoi/blob/main/auth.md>https://github.com/aMytho/GlimBoi/blob/main/auth.md</a></p><p>You can also send feedback for bugs which are found via this link:
